        Accessibility - what have we taken into consideration?
    </h1>
    <p> Accessibility in design is a widespread issue on the internet - that being said, we have taken some steps in attempt to make this page as practical as possible for users. For example, while structuring our code we have tried to use as many semantic elements instead of seperate divs (ex. main and section in the menu) to make the content of the page more comprehensible for screen readers. For the overall design we have tried to keep a high contrast profile to make it easy on the eyes and accounting for people who might have issues with colour vision or other vision impairments. We have also ran the page through a WAVE test to get an automated check of our code and the site visually. (her setter vi inn bilder og forklarer hvordan vi har forandret p√• siden med WAVE feedback) </p>
